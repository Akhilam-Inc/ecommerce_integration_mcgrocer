        "description": "Product details\nNew innovation for menopausal skin.\n\nThe Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone.\n\nNew research has led to Clarins\u2019 discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative.\n\nEach of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams are formulated to adapt to the skin\u2019s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skins microcirculation and boosts radiance. This innovative day and night duo ensure the skins specific needs are met around the clock.\n\nThe Night Cream for Very Dry Skin boosts the skin\u2019s radiance thanks to the service tree bud extract. It is perfect for everyone whose skin needs extra nourishment.\nSuitable for\nDry Skin\nHow to use\nApply in the morning to clean, dry skin. Warm the cream in the hands then place them over the face, working from the middle outward over the face and neck. Apply by gently pressing into the skin, always from the middle of the face outwards to avoid pulling tissues, enhance drainage and preserve features\u2019 youthful appearance.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: France\n\nAddress: CLARINS - 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine - 95300 Pontoise - France\nCLARINS UK - 10 Cavendish Place, London W1G 9DN\nIngredients\nAQUA/WATER/EAU.

        "description": "Product details\nEasy to use spray, now in a bigger value pack. Gently softens & removes ear wax. Reduces the need for syringing. With medical grade olive oil. \n  Ear wax is a natural, oily substance produced to protect the eardrum. In some people this wax can build up which can lead to ear pain or partial hearing loss. Olive oil is a natural lubricant which gently softens and helps remove ear wax. Olive Oil can be used during pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding.\nSuitable for\nSuitable for children 12+, adults and the elderly. Children under the age of 12 should receive medical diagnosis before use. \nHow to use\n\u2022 Check that the nozzle and bottle are not damaged or broken before use.\n\u2022 Before using a new bottle of olive oil, shake well, then press the actuator down 3 to 4 times until you get a spray. This will prime the system for first use.\n\u2022 Tilt head to one side with the affected ear facing upwards.\n\u2022 Holding the bottle in an upright position with the nozzle placed in the ear canal, depress the actuator fully 1 or 2 times.\n\u2022 Gently massage around the outside of the ear.\n\u2022 Plug the ear lightly with cotton wool if required to prevent leakage.\n\u2022 To remove oil, tilt head so that ear is facing downwards and allow oil to drain. Gently wipe outside of ear to remove residue.\n\u2022 Gently wipe nozzle with clean cotton wool after use.\n\u2022 Use the spray twice a day for up to 5 days.\n\u2022 Repeat with other ear if required.\n\u2022 The doctor, nurse, or specialist may advise you with specific instructions for using the spay depending on the severity of the wax problem. You should follow the instructions to ensure removal of wax.\nHazards and Cautions\nChildren under the age of 12 years should receive medical diagnosis before using this spray to confirm earwax is present. Consult your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any other medication in your ears. Do not use if the ear is infected, inflamed or bleeding or if the eardrum is ruptured. There are no known side effects when using olive oil but if you experience any irritation or any other effects stop using them and tell your doctor or pharmacist. Avoid contact with the eyes, in case of accidental contact, rinse thoroughly with clean water and consult a doctor. If symptoms persist, consult your doctor. Keep out of the sight and reach of children. For external use only.\n  Storage \nStore between 10\u02daC - 25\u02daC. Do not use after the expiry date printed on the carton and label.

Skin\u2019s moisture barrier is strengthened and skin feels soothed, with lipids and cica. Oil-free\nWhat It Does\nOur richest formula yet, with actived aloe water and caffeine, sets non-stop hydration into motion. Then, with a trio of lipids, helps lock in moisture in. Keeps skin hydrated for 72 hours, leaving it glowing, looking plump, and feeling velvety-smooth. Dry, dehydrated skin feels soothed with cica.\nKey Ingredients/Technology\nHyaluronic acid: This moisture-binding ingredient has the unique ability to hold 1,000 times its weight in water, helping to create a \u201cmoisture reservoir\u201d for ideal hydration.\nActivated aloe water: Water is infused with aloe leaf extract to help deliver intense hydration.\nCica: Also known as tiger grass, cica is a centuries-old ingredient used in ancient Chinese tradition. Helps soothe dry, delicate skin.\nAuto-Replenishing Lipid-Filler Technology: Using activated aloe water and caffeine, this technology helps support skin\u2019s natural hydration. Uses three types of lipids to help support skin\u2019s moisture barrier locking in hydration.\nGreat To Know:\nOur packaging: Now in more sustainable packaging. 30ml, 50ml, and 125ml are made from glass that\u2019s recyclable. 15ml jar is made with minimum 44% post-consumer recycled material. Please remove cap to recycle.\nWhat does post-consumer recycled (PCR) material mean? It\u2019s a material (such as a plastic water bottle) that's already been used and would otherwise have been thrown away. This reduces the creation of new plastic waste.\u00e2\u0080\u008b\nHow to recycle: The glass jars are recyclable. Remove the cap, then rinse the jar and place in a recycling bin\u00e2\u0080\u008b.\nSuitable for\nAll skin types\nHow to use\nApply AM and PM on clean skin.

Clearblue Digital Ovulation Test kit is proven to help you get pregnant (1), by accurately pinpointing your 2 best days to get pregnant each cycle.\n\nThe ovulation stick shows a clear smiley face on the digital display when your LH surge has been detected, so you know that today and tomorrow are your best 2 days when you're trying for a baby. When trying to get pregnant, taking folic acid or pre-pregnancy vitamins is all good advice, but it's really important to have sex at the right time during your cycle.\n\nThe days leading up to and including the day of ovulation are the only days each cycle when a woman can get pregnant. Unlike basal body temperature (BBT) charting, ovulation predictor kits detect the rise in luteinising hormone (LH test)\u2014a key fertility hormone that rises prior to ovulation\u2014to accurately detect the days BEFORE, and not AFTER ovulation. Whilst ovulation test strips are widely available, 7 in 10 [73%] women did not find strip tests easy to use (2). Clearblue Digital Ovulation Test is over 99% accurate at detecting the LH surge and has been validated by ultrasound (3).\n\n(1) Product data on file.\n(2) In a study of 111 women in the UK using and reading different test types. Data on file.\n(3) A study of 40 women found agreement with ovulation observed by ultrasound.\n\nTo find out if your phone is compatible and if the Clearblue Period & Cycle Tracker app is available in the country you live in, check out: clearblue.com/connectivity\n\n\nFind your 2 peak days: at home urine test which pinpoints your 2 most fertile days, to maximise your chances of getting pregnant\n\nOver 99% accurate at detecting the luteinising hormone (LH) surge. Hormones are a more accurate predictor of ovulation than basal body temperature (BBT), which only rises after ovulation\n\nEasy to read: the only brand giving a unique digital \u2018smiley face\u2019 when it detects the LH surge in your urine, prior to ovulation\n\nOnce your LH surge is detected have sex at any time during the following 48 hours to maximise your chances of getting pregnant\n\nNo. 1 UK Doctor recommended brand in a survey of doctors in the UK (data on file).

You may need to continue testing with a new pack.You may get misleading results if you are pregnant, have recently been pregnant, have reached the menopause, have impaired liver or kidney function, have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).Always read the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for any medication you are taking before testingYou may get misleading results if you are taking fertility drugs containing luteinising hormone (LH) or human Chorionic Gonadotrophin, or are taking antibiotics containing tetracyclines. Clomiphene citrate does not affect the tests.If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception your cycles may be irregular so you may wish to wait until you have had 2 cycles before testing.As prenatal care is very important for a baby\u2019s health, we recommend that you consult your doctor before you try to conceive. Check with your doctor if you are taking any medication or have any medical condition before planning a pregnancy. If you have a medically diagnosed fertility problem, ask your doctor if this test is suitable for you and if you do get unexpected results discuss them with your doctor.If you are under 35 years and haven\u2019t become pregnant, we recommend you see your doctor after 12 months. If you\u2019re over 35 years see your doctor if you haven\u2019t become pregnant after 6 months, and straight away if you are over 40.This IVD digital device meets the emissions and immunity requirements of EN 61326-2-6.

        "description": "Product details\nNew innovation for menopausal skin.\n\nThe Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone.\n\nNew research has led to Clarins\u2019 discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative.\n\nEach of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams are formulated to adapt to the skin\u2019s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skins microcirculation and boosts radiance. This innovative day and night duo ensure the skins specific needs are met around the clock.\n\nThe Day Cream for Very Dry Skin protects the skin from pollutants due to its anti-pollution complex, protects the skin\u2019s natural barrier with vegetal squalene and instantly smooths the skin thanks to line filing pearls. It is perfect for everyone whose skin needs extra nourishment.\nSuitable for\nDry skin\nHow to use\nApply in the morning to clean, dry skin. Warm the cream in the hands then place them over the face, working from the middle outward over the face and neck. Apply by gently pressing into the skin, always from the middle of the face outwards to avoid pulling tissues, enhance drainage and preserve features\u2019 youthful appearance.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: France\n\nAddress: CLARINS - 92200 Neuilly-sur-Seine - 95300 Pontoise - France\nCLARINS UK - 10 Cavendish Place, London W1G 9DN\nIngredients\nAQUA/WATER/EAU.

Cleanse with Facial Soap, Exfoliate with Clarifying Lotion, moisturize with Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion+, oil-free Gel, lightweight Jelly, or rich Cream.\n\nDid you know Clinique\u2019s exfoliating lotion is different from a toner?\n\nToners are primarily used to help rebalance skin after cleansing. Clinique Clarifying Lotion is formulated with exfoliating ingredients to help remove dead cells on skin\u2019s surface. Clearing away that debris helps allow your skincare to work better. After using Clarifying Lotion, your skin can more readily absorb moisturiser and other treatment products.\n\nKey Ingredients\nSalicylic acid\n\nWitch hazel - Helps refine skin.\n\nAcetyl glucosamine - Helps balance and smooth skin.\n\n\nSkin-Typed Formulas\nClinique Clarifying Lotion is available in 5 skin-typed formulas. Our formulas are powered by ingredients* like BHA (salicylic acid), witch hazel, acetyl glucosamine for just-right, twice-daily exfoliation. Which formula is just right for your skin?\n\nClarifying Lotion 1.0: Extra-gentle, alcohol-free formula is safe for sensitive skin.\n\nClarifying Lotion 1: Mild for very dry skin.\n\nClarifying Lotion 2: Gentle for dry combination skin.\n\nClarifying Lotion 3: Great for combination oily skin.\n\nClarifying Lotion 4: Formulated for oily skin.\n\n\n*Specific ingredients vary by skin-typed formula.\n\nFormula Facts\nDermatologist developed\n\nDermatologist tested\n\nSafe for sensitive skin\n\nAllergy tested\n\nFragrance free\n\n\nFree Of\nFragrance\n\nDrying alcohol\n\nOil\n\n\nClinique 3-Step System\n3 steps. 3 minutes.\n\nTwice a day.\n\nClinique\u2019s original dermatologist-developed routine is simple, effective, iconic.

        "description": "Product details\nNew innovation for menopausal skin.\n\nThe Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone.\n\nNew research has led to Clarins\u2019 discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative.\n\nEach of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams are formulated to adapt to the skin\u2019s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skins microcirculation and boosts radiance.

        "description": "Product details\nNew innovation for menopausal skin.\n\nThe Super Restorative range is ideal for all women experiencing the effects of hormonal changes associated with menopause and has been formulated to support the skin during this stage of a woman's life. The skin is a hormone dependent organ and the changes in hormones during peri and the start of post-menopause result in the skin becoming unbalanced. This disruption means that the skin struggles to protect itself during the day as well as reactivate itself at night. This can result in signs of ageing becoming more visible. The nourishing and revitalising formulas of Super Restorative help to fight visible changes on the skin which include dryness, skin slackening, loss of density, deep-set wrinkles, and an uneven skin tone.\n\nNew research has led to Clarins\u2019 discovery of organic harungana which has intensive replenishment and anti-ageing benefits and offers the same effect as retinol whilst being tolerated by all skin types. Organic harungana is combined with our new plant discovery, organic gorse extract, which helps improve the tone of fibroblasts by up to 89% and provides a firmer, more toned skin alongside other ingredients such as organic desert date extract, organic sea lily and vitamin C derivative.\n\nEach of the Super Restorative Day & Night creams are formulated to adapt to the skin\u2019s chronobiology. During the day, the skin is vulnerable and needs protection and the squalane extract found in our day formulas reinforces the hydrolipidic film and protects the skin. At night, the skin needs reactivating as microcirculation slows. Organic service tree bud extract helps to stimulate the skins microcirculation and boosts radiance. This innovative day and night duo ensure the skins specific needs are met around the clock.\n\nThe Day Cream for All Skin Types protects the skin from pollutants due to its anti-pollution complex, protects the skin\u2019s natural barrier with vegetal squalene and instantly smooths the skin thanks to line filing pearls.\nSuitable for\nNormal, Oily, Combination, Dry\nHow to use\nApply in the morning to clean, dry skin. Warm the cream in the hands then place them over the face, working from the middle outward over the face and neck.

        "description": "Product details\nTrying for a baby? Double your chances of getting pregnant (1) with Clearblue Advanced Digital Ovulation kit. You can also track your cycles in our FREE app, designed for use with Clearblue Advanced Digital or Digital Ovulation Tests. Clearblue Advanced Digital Ovulation kit typically identifies 4 or more fertile days (2) when you have the best chances to get pregnant each cycle.\n\nBy accurately tracking 2 key fertility hormones, estrogen and luteinising hormone, this ovulation test not only identifies 2 peak fertility days, but also additional high fertility days before that. This means you have more opportunities to get pregnant - at least twice as many as with any other ovulation test (2)\n\nUnlike basal body temperature (BBT) charting, ovulation predictor kits detect the rise in luteinising hormone (LH) that rises prior to ovulation to accurately detect the day BEFORE, and day of ovulation. Clearblue Advanced Digital Ovulation Test detects estrogen which rises prior to the LH surge to detect more fertile days.

Some fertility treatments such as clomiphene citrate may give misleading High Fertility results but Peak Fertility results should not be affected.If you have recently stopped using hormonal contraception your cycles may be irregular so you may wish to wait until you have had 2 cycles before testing.As prenatal care is very important for a baby\u2019s health, we recommend that you consult your doctor before you try to conceive. Check with your doctor if you are taking any medication or have any medical condition before planning a pregnancy. If you have a medically diagnosed fertility problem, ask your doctor if this test is suitable for you and if you do get unexpected results discuss them with your doctor.If you are under 35 years and haven\u2019t become pregnant, we recommend you see your doctor after 12 months. If you\u2019re over 35 years see your doctor if you haven\u2019t become pregnant after 6 months, and straight away if you are over 40.This IVD digital device meets the missions and immunity requirements of EN 61326-2-6.
