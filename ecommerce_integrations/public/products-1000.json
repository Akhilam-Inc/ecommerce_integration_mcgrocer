Full of clean, protective, hydrating coverage, free of dryness. \nHOW TO USE:\nWe recommend pairing tinted moisturiser with the Smoothing Face Brush. The dual-fiber, synthetic brush is designed to help you blend seamlessly and create a naturally airbrushed finish. Squeeze a pearl-size amount of tinted moisturiser onto the Smoothing Face Brush and blend anywhere you want sheer coverage. For medium coverage, just continue to layer with the same brush. You can also apply with your fingertips: just dot onto your cheeks, forehead, chin and nose, then blend outward. For fuller coverage, apply Complexion Rescue Hydrating Foundation Stick SPF 25 over the tinted moisturiser. \nTips - For a more matte finish, set with Mineral Veil Finishing Powder - To add blue light protection, first apply Complexion Rescue Defense Radiant Protective Veil.\nKEY INGREDIENTS:\n- Skin-loving minerals\n- Hyaluronic Acid\n- Olive\n- Squalane\nHow to use\nApply with your fingertips: Dot onto your cheeks, forehead, chin and nose, then blend outward.\nPair with the Smoothing Face Brush: Squeeze a pearl-sized amount onto the brush and blend.\nFor more coverage, continue to layer with the brush.\nFor oily skin, try our COMPLEXION RESCUE® Natural Matte Tinted Moisturiser Mineral SPF 30. Apply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure.\nHazards and Cautions\nCaution: Avoid direct contact with eyes.\n\nSPF:\nApply liberally 15 minutes before sun exposure.\nChildren under 6 months of age: Ask a doctor.\nSun Protection Measures: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.

I want to return it but the boots returns process involves printing out forms and is so much more fuss, presumably to make it as difficult as possible to return so I’m not happy with the ring or boots, I am seeing if the burn scars before deciding on what action to take next.\nDid you receive a free sample of this product?No\nNo, I wouldn't recommend this product.\nWas this review helpful?\n(1)\n(4)\nReport review\n5 out of 5 stars.\nGreat Wand!\nheather\nVERIFIED PURCHASE\na year ago\ngreat wand! heats up quickly, works on midlength hair well, leaves hair feeling soft.

I have medium length hair and it curls ok, but by the time I moved onto another section of my hair the curls have dropped, spent absolutely ages a few times trying and cannot get on with these at all, a shame as feel it was a bit of a waste of money and now have to buy another set. Only gave 2 stars as they do heat and cool down quickly.\nDid you receive a free sample of this product?No\nNo, I wouldn't recommend this product.\nWas this review helpful?\n(0)\n(2)\nReport review\nShow more\nshopping with us\nA-Z Brands\nA-Z Store\nBoots Advantage Card\nBoots app\nsitemap\ncustomer services\nhelp & FAQs\ndelivery information\nreturns & exchange\nproduct recall\ncontact us\nabout Boots\ncompany information\nenvironmental, social & governance\nmodern slavery & human trafficking\ncareers\nprivacy & cookies\nterms & conditions\naccessibility\nOur partner sites\nWe accept\nCopyright © The Boots Company PLC.

So when you go out, we recommend protecting your little one with high protection sun cream, sunglasses and a hat, and putting them in an anti-UV playpen!\nThe Aquani helps you to protect your baby from the sun. With its high protection (SPF 50+), it blocks up to 99% of harmful rays (UVA and UVB). It also protects your little one from sand, wind and insects thanks to its folding mosquito net. Your little one can easily play with the toys provided. As your baby gets older and bigger, you can clip the toys in different places. Crinkly paper, coloured rings... your little one is spoiled for choice for early learning!  \nLying comfortably on the Aquani’s mattress, they can also sleep safely wherever you are.\nThe Babymoov Aquani is adaptable so you can continue to use it as your baby grows. The Aquani has a removable canopy and waterproof fabric. Just remove the mattress to turn it into a large paddling pool (up to 75 litres). Your baby can splash around in complete safety with you there alongside. On the inside, remove the canopy to turn your Aquani into a playpen or ball pit!\nWell designed, practical and easy to assemble, the Aquani is easy to take with you in its carry bag with wide shoulder strap.

It looks stylish and fits the aesthetics of a modern home, giving it a contemporary vibe. \nThe gliding motion can be operated by a parent, but it can also start on its own when your baby stirs or rolls, putting them back to sleep or a nap. Its smooth, quiet movement is great for soothing your baby to sleep.

Assembly and disassembly are very simple and quick-you can do this in less than a minute! To take it apart, just take off the small legs and fold the bassinet. No other tools are needed. The crib fits in a compact travel bag and weighs only 6 kg. You can take it with you for overnight stays as your travel cot for the first 6 months.\nThe crib has a perfect height of 74 cm, offering easy access to your baby anywhere in your home. The Air Motion Gliding Crib is designed to be positioned next to your bed. Its standalone design and double mesh sides ensure that you can see your baby at all times, yet they are in their own, safe sleeping space. \nThe Babymore Air Motion Gliding Crib has won GOLD in the 2023 Mother & Baby Awards for ‘Best Cot, Crib, or Moses Basket” category along with GOLD in the 2022 Made for Mums Awards.\nWe recommend the Babymore Air Motion Gliding Crib fitted sheets, which are designed specifically for this crib and come in a pack of two sheets. \nKey features:\nGentle side to side motion, “floating on air” gliding sensation\nBreathable mesh panels with machine washable cover \nReflux wedge included \nComfortable breathable fibre core mattress - chemical free with a washable cover\nAssembles in less than a minute and is super lightweight\nFolds away easily and quickly into a small travel bag\nAward winning - Mother & Baby Award 2023 GOLD / Made for Mums 2022 GOLD\nSuitable for\nFrom birth to 6 months or 9 kg\nHow to use\nInstructions manual included and available on www.babymore.co.uk",

    "description": "Product details\nThe BARBER PRO ANTI-AGEING Vitamin C Sheet Mask is an energising formula that tackles the signs of tiredness and ageing. Using the power of Blueberry, Yuzu Citrus and Sea Buckthorn, this formula will increase the skin’s hydration, brighten the complexion and reduce the appearance of dark circles, redness, fine lines and wrinkles.\n  The sheet mask uses our NEW 100% Biodegradable Packaging. Our plastic pouches will also degrade to nothing more than carbon dioxide, water and biomass. This means no microplastics left behind to pose a threat to the environment. The sheet mask itself is constructed with bamboo fibres, which not only minimise skin sensitivity but also makes the mask biodegradable. \n\nRich in Vitamin C, Blueberries provide vital nutrients to the cells to allow them to function to a high capacity and in turn helps your skin to appear brighter and more energised. Yuzu Fruit stimulates collagen production which renews the cells, improving elasticity and creating a smoother and more even surface. Sea Buckthorn deeply hydrates the skin as well as protecting it from environmental stressors.\nUsing this sheet mask weekly will help you to fight dull skin and wrinkles to achieve a bright, youthful and healthy complexion.\n  The BARBER PRO ANTI-AGEING Vitamin C Sheet Mask is 100% plant based.\nSuitable for\nVegans\nHow to use\n1. Cleanse the skin to prepare for mask application\n2. Remove the mask from the packaging and carefully unfold the mask\n3. Place on your face and ensure good coverage, wear for 15 - 20 minutes\n4. After 15 - 20 minutes has passed, remove the mask\nHazards and Cautions\nExternal use only. Avoid contact with eyes and damaged skin. In case of eye contact, rinse thoroughly with water.

But we love using them: It has been estimated that we used over 500 billion of these worldwide in 2017.\n\nSadly, most are made of plastic, which needs centuries to break down. In the meantime, animals mistake it for food, which eventually kills them.\n\nA sustainable alternative to plastic is bamboo. Bamboo cotton buds are biodegradable while being as sturdy and durable as the plastic version. So, they are the perfect alternative.\nHow to use\nUse the bamboo cotton bud as a conventional cotton bud. Afterwards, you can dispose of it in your personal or local compost.

It's the doctor-invented nasal aspirator that actually works!\nHYGIENIC: Disposable filters are clinically proven to prevent the transfer of mucus or bacterial germs to the snot sucker when clearing stuffy noses. Replace filter after every use.\nCOMFORTABLE + NON-INVASIVE: NoseFrida creates a seal with the outside of the baby’s nostril for gentle snotsucking.\nDISHWASHER SAFE: The blue nasal tube, red mouthpiece, and filter cap are top-rack dishwasher safe for easy cleaning.\nPEDIATRICIAN RECOMMENDED: BPA + Phthalate-free. Safe for all ages.\nBABY REGISTRY ESSENTIAL: Includes 1 NoseFrida, 1 Travel Storage Case and 4 Hygiene Filters\n\n\n  To Use\nPlace large tube ageist child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot.\n\nTips:\nSpraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida.\nMove tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose.\nChange filter after each use to maintain suction.\nHazards and Cautions\nTube does not go inside the nose, so baby will not get injured if he/she moves. Only use NoseFrida for nasal aspiration - do not use in ears or throat. DO NOT BLOW air into red mouthpiece while tube is placed at child's nostril. NoseFrida is NOT a toy - keep all parts away from children.

    "description": "Product details\nCosyhead Fresh, the head support that helps reduce flat head syndrome to ensure proper development!\n\nCo-developed with a French paediatrician, this unique head support is specially designed to respect your baby's morphology. It provides an optimal position that prevents plagiocephaly and maintains your baby's head perfectly round, ensuring pressure distribution on the baby's skull.\n\nThis pillow is made of certified organic cotton OCS and Tencel (TM), providing unparalleled comfort.\n\nThe Cosyhead Fresh is made of Lyocell-Tencel®, a naturally ultra-soft and breathable material that ensures good ventilation of the head and neck to limit baby's sweating.\n\nVersatile and practical, this head support can be used from birth in various environments, whether in a bouncer, carrycot, stroller, etc. Its portable and compact design allows you to take it with you everywhere, providing your baby with the same comfort wherever you go.\n\nFeaturing a non-slip back for better grip, the Cosyhead Fresh is recommended for use up until your baby is 3 months old or able to roll over unaided.\n\nMade in Europe, this pillow offers your infant a healthy, comfortable and non restrictive support for proper development.\nHazards and Cautions\nIMPORTANT! Read carefully and keep for future reference.\nWARNING\n∙ Stop using the product once your baby is 3 months old, or starts to roll over\nunaided, or is too big to fit into it properly. RISK OF SUFFOCATION.\n∙ Do not use pillows, blankets or additional padding underneath or beside the\ninfant. RISK OF SUFFOCATION.\n∙ Do not use this product in an adult bed. RISK OF SUFFOCATION.\n∙ Do not use this product at height. RISK OF FALLING.\n∙ Remove the child before moving the product.\n∙ Beware of the danger of placing the cot near naked flames and other sources of\nintense heat such as gas or electric heaters, etc.\n∙ Stop using the product once the child starts moving around, and wanting to\nturn over. This is because the child’s movements may cause them to roll off the\nproduct and onto their side, or end up with their face against the mattress in\na position where they cannot breathe. Medical opinion states that babies gain\nthis ability to move at around 3 months, but users should be reminded of the\nimportance of pre-empting this and looking out for their child gaining these\nnew skills.\n∙ Using the product beyond the age indicated can have serious consequences\nfor the child.\n∙ Check that all parts of the product are correctly assembled before use.\n∙ Do not use the product if any components are broken or missing.\n∙ Right from birth, place your baby on their back, fl at, in their own cot with a fi rm\nmattress. Never place them on their tummy or side.\n∙ Up to the age of 6 months, parents are recommended to sleep in the same room\nas their baby, placing the cot next to their bed. It is recommended to place your\nbaby in their cot on their own, on a fi rm mattress the same size as the cot. No\nitems should be placed in their cot: no cot bumpers, blankets, duvets, pillows,\ntoys or soft toys.\n∙ Ensure that the child’s chin does not rest on their chest by ensuring that two\nadult fingers can fit in the space between the chin and the torso, so that their\nbreathing is not impeded.\n∙ Take into account the temperature of the room and the nightwear worn by the\nchild, and ensure that the child is neither too hot nor too cold; excessive heat\ncan endanger the life of your child. A temperature of 19 °C is recommended. The\nair in the bedroom must not be too humid or too dry, and the room should be\nventilated every day to provide fresh air.\n∙ The item should be washed prior to first use according to\nthe manufacturer’s instructions.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: China\n\nAddress: 3rd Floor, East Reach House, East Reach, Taunton, TA1 3EN – www.babymoov.co.uk\nParc Industriel des Gravanches, 16, rue Jacqueline Auriol, 63051 Clemont-Ferrand Cedex 2, France – www.babymoov.com",

    "description": "Product details\nBabyway 3 in 1 Baby Carrier\n\nParents will love this Carrier for its host of features as well as its simple design. It offers three carry positions, taking you from cradling your newborn to leisurely walks out with your toddler. The carrier can be used with babies from birth with weight range of 3.5kg to a maximum12kg.\n\nIt includes padded shoulder straps and lumbar support, cushioned leg openings and a back strap to help spread baby’s weight, so it can be used with comfort and ease. The padded seat and internal support promote baby’s natural spread squat in all positions, aiding their hip and spine development.\n\nBreathable cool mesh fabric helps to keep baby cool and reduce sweating during the summer months. There’re also hi-visibility reflective strips running the height of the carrier at both sides to increase low light visibility when on for those Autumn / Winter strolls or even crossing the road.\n\nFront Facing Position - From birth, in the front-facing position, your baby benefits from close contact and interaction with you.\n\nOutward Facing Position - When they’re around three months old or can hold up their own head, the outward facing position (with the adjustable head cushion removed and neck support folded over) lets them explore the world around them.\n\nBack Carrying Position - When your little once is feeling more confident, you can convert to the back carrying position.\nHazards and Cautions\nThe babyway 3 in 1 baby carrier is suitable for babies from birth with a weight of 3.5kg to 12kg.\n\nYour child must face towards you until he or she can hold their head upright (about 4 to 5 months old).\n\nHold your baby closely at all times until the buckles are correctly attached.\n\nMake sure your baby is properly positioned with their legs straddling the seat.\n\nCheck all buckles and adjustments are secure before each use.\n\nPull all straps closely around you.Always make sure there is enough room around baby’s nose and mouth to provide clear air.Never lie down with your baby in the baby carrier.\n\nInspect the baby carrier regularly for any signs of wear and tear.\n\nYour child MUST be able to sit upright unassisted to use the backpack position (about 6 months old).\n\nSmall children can fall through a leg opening. Adjust leg openings to fit baby’s legs snugly.\n\nCare instructions can be found on the label on the baby carrier.\n\nNEVER leave your child in the carrier unless it is being worn, as your child may suffocate or fall.\n\nDO NOT use in exercise activities or motorised vehicles.\n\nDO NOT bend over at your waist; bend at the knees. To be carried by adults while standing or walking only.\n\nDISCONTINUE use if damaged, broken or parts are missing.\n\nCheck REGULARLY that your child is secure, comfortable, that their face is uncovered and that they are breathing freely.\n\nFor low birthweight babies and children with medical conditions, seek advice from a health professional before using this product.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nAddress: Babyway International Ltd, Neptune Way, Huddersfield, HD2 1UA",

Your baby may need more or less than the feeding guide above. This information is given as a guide only. Consult your healthcare professional if you require more advice. Important: Always use the scoop provided, please note the colour of the scoop in this pack may change from time to time. How to use this pack To open, remove tamper evidence strip on the rim of pack. There is a handy leveller built into the pack. Store your scoop in the lid so that it is kept safe and secure. Click the lid securely shut to keep your powder fresh. Preparing your baby's feed Because powdered milks are not sterile, failure to follow instructions may make your baby ill. 1 Wash hands and sterilise all utensils according to manufacturers' instructions. 2 Boil 1 litre of freshly run water. Leave kettle to cool for 45 minutes and no longer. Measure the required amount of water (refer to feeding guide) into a sterilised bottle. Be careful of scalding. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water. 3 Using the scoop provided level off the powder with the built-in leveller. Do not press/heap the powder. 4 Add the correct measure of powder to the water. Adding too many or too few scoops can be harmful. Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle. Hold the bottle horizontally and shake from left to right for 10 seconds, then hold it vertically and shake from top to bottom for 10 seconds. The time between adding the scoops and shaking the bottle should be as short as possible. 5 Leave the bottle to stand for 5 minutes to allow it to thicken. Turn the bottle upside down just before feeding. Check temperature of feed. Feed immediately. You may notice that your baby's stools change consistency when using this formula. This is completely normal. Important feeding advice Make up each feed as required. For hygiene reasons, do not store made up feeds, discard unfinished feeds as soon as possible, and always within 2 hours. Do not heat feeds in a microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding. Never add extra scoops or anything else to your baby's feed. Never leave your baby alone during feeding.\nHazards and Cautions\nFood Supplements are intended to supplement the diet and should not be regarded as a substitute for a balanced and varied diet or a healthy lifestyle.\n\nWhile every care has been taken to ensure this information is as accurate as possible, recipes and nutrition content may occasionally change.

In the meantime, animals mistake it for food, which eventually kills them.\n\nA sustainable alternative to plastic is bamboo. Bamboo cotton buds are biodegradable while being as sturdy and durable as the plastic version. So, they are the perfect alternative.\nHow to use\nUse the bamboo cotton bud as a conventional cotton bud. Afterwards, you can dispose of it in your personal or local compost.

Aptamil® Follow on Milk is formulated to help meet the increased nutritional needs of infants from 6 to 12 months. This information is given as a guide only. Consult your healthcare professional if you require more advice.\n\nImportant: always use the scoop provided, please note the colour of the scoop may change from time to time.\n\nHow to Use This Pack\nInside the box are two foil sachets and a scoop to measure the correct amount of powder. For ease, remove one foil sachet from the box and store it until required. Open the other sachet with scissors, cutting along the top. To dose, carefully fold the open end of the foil sachet over. To maintain the best quality, we recommend using a clip* to reseal the sachet.\n\n*Clip is not included.\n\nPrep: Wash hands and sterilise all utensils.\n\nWater: Boil 1 litre of freshly run water in a kettle then leave to cool for 30 minutes and no more so the water can reach the recommended temperature of 70°C. When ready, pour the right amount of water into a sterilised beaker, as per the feeding guide. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly bolled water.\n\nPowder: Using the scoop, add the powder to the water, as per the feeding guide. To make sure the right amount of powder is added, level off the powder with a clean, dry knife. Don't press or heap the powder as adding too much or too little formula could make your baby ill.\n\nShake: Place the sterilised lid on the beaker and shake straight away. For best results, shake vertically and vigorously for at least 10 seconds, until all of the powder is dissolved.\n\nCool the beaker by placing under a cold running tap or in a bowl of cold water, and check the temperature by placing a few drops on the inside of your wrist. The formula should feel lukewarm, but not hot. If possible, we'd recommend starting the feed straight away and finishing within 2 hours.\n\n\nImportant Feeding and Storage Advice\nMake up each feed as required.\nFor hygiene reasons, do not store made up feeds, discard unfinished feeds as soon as possible, and always within 2 hours.\nDo not heat feeds in a microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding.\nNever add extra scoops or anything else to your baby's feed.\nNever leave your baby alone during feeding.\nHazards and Cautions\nFood Supplements are intended to supplement the diet and should not be regarded as a substitute for a balanced and varied diet or a healthy lifestyle.\n\nWhile every care has been taken to ensure this information is as accurate as possible, recipes and nutrition content may occasionally change. As a result, we recommend that you always read the label carefully before consuming any product. The Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) or Reference Intake (RI) as a percentage, helps to show the contribution that a product or portion size can make towards daily intakes. This information is provided as a guide and is not individual advice.\n\nThis product is made to strict hygiene standards but because powdered formula milks are not sterile, failure to follow instructions on preparation and storage may make your baby ill.\n\nImportant notice\nBreastfeeding is best. Follow-on milk is only for babies over 6 months, as part of a mixed diet. If should not be used as a breastmilk substitute before 6 months. The decision to start weaning including the use of this product before 6 months should be made only on the advice of a doctor, dietitian, pharmacist, or other professional responsible for maternal and child care, based on baby's individual needs. When bottle feeding do not allow prolonged or frequent contact of milk feeds with your baby's teeth as this increases the risk of tooth decay. Ask your healthcare professional or dentist for advice.

    "description": "Product details\nBabymoov Lovenest Original antibacterial head support natural care\n\nLovenest Natural Care - the newborn organic cotton head support pillow promotes the healthy development of a well-rounded head within the first 3 months while baby's skull is still soft! Developed and patented by French Paediatrician Dr Maidenberg, the anti-flat head pillow , is specially angled and shaped to suit the shape of an infant's skull to ensure an even distribution of pressure across the back of the head, while still allowing freedom of movement. During the first months of their life, your baby can spend hours on their back.\n\nTo reduce the risk of flat head (plagiocephaly) from forming, use a Lovenest pillow under baby’s head on an activity mat, in their cot, pram or even a baby bouncer. Unique to the Lovenest Natural Care which is made in Portugal, it is specifically designed for newborn babies with a weak immune system. The copper thread, which is woven into the organic cotton mesh, eliminates 99.9% of bacteria, reduces odours, and protects the skin from infections. This exclusive patented technology is 100% natural and involves no chemical treatments atall. The Lovenest Natural Care is machine-washable at 30°C without damaging the anti-bacterial properties of the copper thread. Use the Lovenest Natural Care straight from birth and up to 3 -4 months old or until baby is able to roll over unaided.\nHazards and Cautions\nIt can be used from birth to 3 months\nStop using the head support once the child is able to turn over unaided\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: Portugal\n\nAddress: 3rd Floor, East Reach House, East Reach, Taunton, TA1 3EN – www.babymoov.co.uk\nParc Industriel des Gravanches, 16, rue Jacqueline Auriol, 63051 Clemont-Ferrand Cedex 2, France – www.babymoov.com",

    "description": "Product details\nBabymoov Cosydream Original\n\nSleep is precious!\n\nAfter spending nine months in your tummy, your newborn may feel unsettled by their new surroundings. They need to adapt from a fœtal position in which they felt safe and protected to a lying position stretching their unused and undeveloped abdominals. These new sensations may disrupt sleep and, consequently, development.\n\nFurthermore, the sleeping position of babies flat on their back is recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to combat sudden infant death syndrome.\n\nBabymoov understand the importance of sleep and have designed for you and your little one, an innovative range for a safer and more comforting sleeping environment, all designed with the advice of medical professionals and fully tested by independent laboratories to ensure compliance with safety requirements\n\nFeatures and benefits:\nPerfect position for baby: back support and raised legs\nHead support for a nice and round head\nMemory foam for optimum comfort\nAdjustable leg support roll according to baby’s size\nUltra-soft, breathable fabric\nCan be used with a inclined cot wedge\n\nMaterial composition:\nOutside: Cotton/Polyester\nInside: 100% polyurethane\n\nDimensions: 58 x 38 x 8 cm\n\nAs trust is the must-have factor in baby equipment, Babymoov is committed to offering safe, quality products, all certified by independent laboratories. And Babymoov’s lifetime warranty on all its products vouches for this.\n\nAge recommendation(min): 0+\nAge recommendation(max): 4-6 months\n\n\n\nHazards and Cautions\nIMPORTANT! Read carefully and keep for future reference.\nWARNING\nStop using the product once your baby is 3 months old, or starts to roll over unaided, or is too big to fit into it properly. RISK OF SUFFOCATION.\nDo not use pillows, blankets, or additional padding underneath or beside the infant. RISK OF SUFFOCATION.\nDo not use this product in an adult bed. RISK OF SUFFOCATION.\nDo not use this product at height. RISK OF FALLING.\nRemove the child before moving the product.\nBeware of the danger of placing the cot near naked flames and other sources of intense heat such as gas or electric heaters.\nStop using the product once the child starts moving around and wanting to turn over. This is because the child's movements may cause them to roll off the product and onto their side, or end up with their face against the mattress in a position where they cannot breathe.\nMedical opinion states that babies gain this ability to move at around 3 months, but users should be reminded of the importance of preempting this and looking out for their child gaining these new skills.\nUsing the product beyond the indicated age can have serious consequences for the child.\nCheck that all parts of the product are correctly assembled before use.\nDo not use the product if any components are broken or missing.\nRight from birth, place your baby on their back, flat, in their own cot with a firm mattress. Never place them on their tummy or side.\nUp to the age of 6 months, parents are recommended to sleep in the same room as their baby, placing the cot next to their bed. It is recommended to place your baby in their cot on their own, on a firm mattress the same size as the cot. No items should be placed in their cot: no cot bumpers, blankets, duvets, pillows, toys, or soft toys.\nEnsure that the child’s chin does not rest on their chest by ensuring that two adult fingers can fit in the space between the chin and the torso, so that their breathing is not impeded.\nTake into account the temperature of the room and the nightwear worn by the child, and ensure that the child is neither too hot nor too cold; excessive heat can endanger the life of your child. A temperature of 19°C is recommended. The air in the bedroom must not be too humid or too dry, and the room should be ventilated every day to provide fresh air.\nEnsure that the belt does not press on the child's abdomen and thorax by ensuring that two adult fingers can fit in the space between the belt and the child's body.\nIt is designed to keep the child in position when they unexpectedly start to move for the first time, but it must not be used under any circumstances to restrain a child whose motor skills mean that they are too old to be placed in the product.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: China\n\nAddress: 3rd Floor, East Reach House, East Reach, Taunton, TA1 3EN – www.babymoov.co.uk\nParc Industriel des Gravanches, 16, rue Jacqueline Auriol, 63051 Clemont-Ferrand Cedex 2, France – www.babymoov.com",

Consult your healthcare professional if you require more advice.\n\nImportant: Always use the scoop provided, please note the colour of the scoop in this pack may change from time to time.\n\nHow to Use this Pack\nInside the box are two foil sachets and a scoop to measure the correct of powder. For ease, remove one foil sachet from the box and store it until required. Open the other sachet with scissors, cutting along the top. To close, carefully fold the open end of the foil sachet over. To maintain the best quality, we recommend using a clip∞ to reseal the sachet.\n\n∞Clip is not included.\n\nThis product is made to strict hygiene standards but because powdered formula milks are not sterile, failure to follow instructions on preparation and storage may make your baby ill.\n\n1 Prep: Wash hands and sterilise all utensils.\n2 Water: Boil1 litre of freshly run water in a kettle then leave to cool for 30 minutes and no more so the water can reach the recommended temperature of 70°C. When ready, pour the right amount of water into a sterilised bottle, as per the feeding guide. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water.\n3 Powder: Using the scoop, add the powder to the water, as per the feeding guide. To make sure the right amount of powder is added, level off the powder with a clean, dry knife. Don't press or heap the powder as adding too much or too little formula could make your baby ill.\n4 Shake: Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle and shake straight away. For best results, shake vertically and vigorously for at least 10 seconds, until all of the powder is dissolved.\n5 Cool the bottle by placing under a cold running tap or in a bowl of cold water, and check the temperature by placing a few drops on the inside of your wrist. The formula should feel lukewarm, but not hot.

Assembly and disassembly are very simple and quick-you can do this in less than a minute! To take it apart, just take off the small legs and fold the bassinet. No other tools are needed. The crib fits in a compact travel bag and weighs only 6 kg. You can take it with you for overnight stays as your travel cot for the first 6 months.\nThe crib has a perfect height of 74 cm, offering easy access to your baby anywhere in your home. The Air Motion Gliding Crib is designed to be positioned next to your bed. Its standalone design and double mesh sides ensure that you can see your baby at all times, yet they are in their own, safe sleeping space. \nThe Babymore Air Motion Gliding Crib has won GOLD in the 2023 Mother & Baby Awards for ‘Best Cot, Crib, or Moses Basket” category along with GOLD in the 2022 Made for Mums Awards.\nWe recommend the Babymore Air Motion Gliding Crib fitted sheets, which are designed specifically for this crib and come in a pack of two sheets. \nKey features:\nGentle side to side motion, “floating on air” gliding sensation\nBreathable mesh panels with machine washable cover \nReflux wedge included \nComfortable breathable fibre core mattress - chemical free with a washable cover\nAssembles in less than a minute and is super lightweight\nFolds away easily and quickly into a small travel bag\nAward winning - Mother & Baby Award 2023 GOLD / Made for Mums 2022 GOLD\nSuitable for\nFrom birth to 6 months or 9 kg\nHow to use\nInstructions manual included and available on www.babymore.co.uk",

Developed with a french Occupational Therapist, not only does this design encourage fine motor skills and co-ordination but gives baby early independence to explore foods in their natural shape.

The bottle comes with 2 different flow silicone drinking teats - slow and fast flow depending on your baby/baby's age.

There is no compromise on comfort, health and safety as this adaptable baby carrier was designed in conjunction with Camille Rieu, a physiotherapist specialising in the development of children's motor skills and a mother to 2 children herself. \n\nAs a parent, it always feels disorganised and rushed whenever you need to go out with your baby - then there’s the fear of forgetting something and not having enough space. Make life easier by just taking one item with you for mealtimes as well as travelling. \nWith an ingenious patented system of detachable straps and an inflatable cushion, it takes less than 5 minutes to convert your baby carrier into a secure booster seat! And since we really have thought of everything, the Moov & Boost baby carrier converts into a shoulder bag so it's really easy to carry.\n\nIts ingenious A-line shape moulds to your baby's body shape, and can be used for babies weighing up to 20 kg. It keeps your baby's back in a rounded shape and guarantees they are carried in the healthy 'frog' position which is best for their hips.

For a defined line • Use the side of your brush and glide in short strokes along the upper lash line — starting above your iris, working outward, and stopping where your natural lashes end. • Use the remaining product on your brush to complete the line, gliding from the inner corner towards the center of your eye to create a smooth, saturated line. For a cat eye look: • Use the side of your brush and glide in short strokes along the upper lash line — starting above your iris, working outward, and stopping where your natural lashes end. • Glide the brush from your inner corner, moving towards the center of your eye to create a solid line. • Flip your brush, and extend the line slightly past the outer eye corner. Follow the angle of your lower lash line to ensure your wing is properly positioned and symmetrical on both sides. • For a more dramatic look, apply liner just below your lower lash line, working from the outer corner inward. Please note: you can use either liquid or pencil liner on the lower lash line. For a dramatic winged look: • Use the side of your brush and glide in short strokes along the upper lash line — starting above your iris, working outward, and stopping where your natural lashes end. • Glide from your outer corner towards the inner corner, moving towards the center of your eye to create a solid line. • Reapply eyeliner over the existing line to thicken and enhance, extending it past your outer eye corner until you’ve achieved the desired height. • Next, flip the brush and glide it inwards toward the center of your eye to create an outline of a wing with a bolder line. Fill in any exposed skin for a rich black winged eye.\nHazards and Cautions\nWarning: For external use only. In case of eye irritation, discontinue use and see your ophthamologist immediately.

Your baby may need more or less than the feeding guide above. This information is given as a guide only. Consult your healthcare professional if you require more advice.\n\n1 Prep: Wash hands and sterilise all utensils.\n2 Water: Boil 1 litre of freshly run water in a kettle then leave to cool for 30 minutes and no more so the water can reach the recommended temperature of 70°C. When ready, pour the right amount of water into a sterilised bottle, as per the feeding guide. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water.\n3 Powder: Tear off the top of the sachet and without touching the tabs, add the correct number to the water. Adding too many or too few tabs could make your baby ill.\n4 Shake: Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle and shake straight away. For best results, shake vertically and vigorously for at least 10 seconds, until all of the powder is dissolved.\n5 Cool the bottle by placing under a cold running tap or in a bowl of cold water, and check the temperature by placing a few drops on the inside of your wrist. The formula should feel lukewarm, but not hot. If possible, we'd recommend starting the feed straight away and always finishing within 2 hours.\n\nHow to Store Your Tabs\nWhen you do not use all the tabs in a sachet, fold the top of the sachet.\nFasten it with a clip or store in an air-tight container. (Clip not included)\nAfter opening the sachet, use the remaining tabs as soon as possible, within one week.\n\nImportant Feeding Advice\nDo not feed babies undissolved tabs.\nHandle with care. Tabs may break when dropped or held too firmly.\nMake up each feed as required.\nFor hygiene reasons, do not store made up feeds, discard unfinished feeds as soon as possible, and always within 2 hours.\nDo not heat feeds in a microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding.\nNever add extra tabs or anything else to your baby's feed.\nNever leave your baby alone during feeding.\n\nFollow the preparation instructions at all times, even when on the go.\nPre-Measured First Infant Milk Tabs\n- Easy to carry\n- Just add to water*\n- Accurately measured\n- Simply air-compressed\n- 1 tab = 1 Scoop\n\n*Each tab should be added to 30ml/1fl. oz water.\n\nAlways follow preparation instructions.\nHazards and Cautions\nFood Supplements are intended to supplement the diet and should not be regarded as a substitute for a balanced and varied diet or a healthy lifestyle.\n\nWhile every care has been taken to ensure this information is as accurate as possible, recipes and nutrition content may occasionally change. As a result, we recommend that you always read the label carefully before consuming any product. The Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) or Reference Intake (RI) as a percentage, helps to show the contribution that a product or portion size can make towards daily intakes. This information is provided as a guide and is not individual advice.\n\nStorage\nStore in a cool, dry place.\nDo not refrigerate.\nKeep tabs out of reach of children.\nFor best before, see top of pack.\n\nImportant Notice\nBreastfeeding is best. Infant milk is suitable from birth, when babies are not breastfed and should only be used on the advice of a doctor, dietitian, pharmacist, or other professional responsible for maternal and child care.\n\nWhen bottle feeding do not allow prolonged or frequent contact of milk feeds with your baby's teeth as this increases the risk of tooth decay. Ask your healthcare professional or dentist for advice. Make sure your baby's teeth are cleaned after the last feed at night.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: Poland\n\nAddress: Nutricia Ltd / Nutricia Ireland Ltd\nManufacturer's Address UK: Nutricia Ltd, White Horse Business Park, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, BA14 0XD.\nManufacturer's Address ROI: Nutricia Ireland Ltd, Block 1, Deansgrange Business Park, Deansgrange, Co.

So there’s only one thing you want to do - go out with your baby! \nBefore the age of one, babies do not produce enough melanin to protect them from the sun’s UV rays. So when you go out, it’s essential to protect your little one with high protection sun cream, sunglasses, a hat... So your baby can explore the world around them in complete safety, whether on the beach, in the park or even in the mountains. \nThe Babyni is an anti-UV travel cot and playpen that protects your baby from the sun’s rays as well as from wind, sand and insects. With its high protection (SPF 50+), it blocks up to 99% of harmful rays (UVA and UVB). \nThe Babyni is easy to assemble and store away thanks to its pop-up system, and can be used right from birth. \nWhen it is set up, your little one can lie comfortably on the thick mattress and play or rest.\nThe Babyni has a removable canopy and a fine mesh mosquito net. To protect your baby from insects, the net is elasticated and is easily attached with 2 Velcro strips.\nThe Babyni is versatile - you can use it both outdoors (beach, park, countryside, etc.) and indoors. There are 2 loops for attaching your toys above your baby. \nAnd when your baby grows, you can fold down the canopy and turn the Babyni into a ball pit, for example. \nReally practical, the Babyni folds away easily in its carry bag.

For 1+ years, use Aptamil 3 Toddler Milk Powder 1+ Years 800g.\n\nBreastfeeding is best.\nHow to use\nPreparing Your Baby's Feed\nApprox. 1 beaker: No. of level scoops per feed (1 scoop = 4.8g): 7, Quantity of water per feed: 210ml, 7fl.oz\n\nAfter 6 months, once weaning is established, we recommend giving your baby about 1 pint (500-600ml) per day. Aptamil® Follow On Milk is formulated to help meet the increased nutritional needs of infants from 6 to 12 months. This information is given as a guide only. Consult your healthcare professional if you require more advice.\n\n1 Prep: Wash hands and sterilise all utensils.\n2 Water: Boil 1 litre of freshly run water in a kettle then leave to cool for 30 minutes and no more so the water can reach the recommended temperature of 70°C. When ready, pour the right amount of water into a sterilised beaker, as per the feeding guide. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water.\n3 Powder: Using the scoop, add the powder to the water, as per the feeding guide. To make sure the right amount of powder is added, use the leveller on the inside of the box to level off the scoops. Don't press or heap the powder as adding too much or too little formula could make your baby ill.\n4 Shake: Place the sterilised lid on the beaker and shake straight away. For best results, shake vertically and vigorously for at least 10 seconds, until all of the powder is dissolved.\n5 Cool the beaker by placing under a cold running tap or in a bowl of cold water, and check the temperature by placing a few drops on the inside of your wrist. The formula should feel lukewarm, but not hot. If possible, we'd recommend starting the feed straight away and always finishing within 2 hours.\n\nImportant Feeding Advice\nMake up each feed as required.\nFor hygiene reasons, do not store made up feeds, discard unfinished feeds as soon as possible, and always within 2 hours.\nDo not heat feeds in a microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding.\nNever add extra scoops or anything else to your baby's feed.\nNever leave your baby alone during feeding.\n\nStorage\nStore powder in a cool, dry place.\nDo not refrigerate.\nUse powder within 4 weeks of opening.\nHazards and Cautions\nFood Supplements are intended to supplement the diet and should not be regarded as a substitute for a balanced and varied diet or a healthy lifestyle.\n\nWhile every care has been taken to ensure this information is as accurate as possible, recipes and nutrition content may occasionally change. As a result, we recommend that you always read the label carefully before consuming any product. The Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) or Reference Intake (RI) as a percentage, helps to show the contribution that a product or portion size can make towards daily intakes. This information is provided as a guide and is not individual advice.\n\nIMPORTANT: Always use the scoop provided, please note the colour of the scoop may change from time to time.\n'\nThis product is made to strict hygiene standards but because powdered formula milks are not sterile, failure to follow instructions, on preparation and storage may make your baby ill.\n\nImportant notice\nBreastfeeding is best. Follow-on milk is only for babies over 6 months, as part of a mixed diet. It should not be used as a breastmilk substitute before 6 months. The decision to start weaning including the use of this product before 6 months should be made only on the advice of a doctor, dietitian, pharmacist, or other professional responsible for maternal and child care, based on baby's individual needs.\n\nWhen bottle feeding do not allow prolonged or frequent contact of milk feeds with your baby's teeth as this increases the risk of tooth decay. Ask your healthcare professional or dentist for advice. Make sure your baby's teeth are cleaned after the last feed at night.\nImportant info\nCountry of Origin: Ireland\n\nAddress: Nutricia Ltd / Nutricia Ireland Ltd\nManufacturer's Address UK: Nutricia Ltd, White Horse Business Park, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, BA14 0XD.\nManufacturer's Address ROI: Nutricia Ireland Ltd, Block 1, Deansgrange Business Park, Deansgrange, Co.

The floating and contouring head will follow the curves of your face to ensure both accuracy and comfort.\nThe iStubble will work most effectively when cutting through the hair at its own speed – never force through the hair. You may experience a little resistance when trimming the neck area, where hair is thicker and grows in many different directions. This is completely normal.\nJust like shaving, extra time should be given when trimming under the neck area, as again this is where hairs grow in many different directions.\nNever switch the trimmer off whilst in the hair.\n- Flexing, contouring head for exceptional accuracy and comfort\n- 15 motorised lengths for ultimate precision\n- 0.4mm-15mm\n- LCD Screen displays selected length and charge time remaining\n- Protective comb guide delivers ultimate length consistency\n- Rapid charging system\n- 90 minute charge provides 60 minutes of cordless use\n- Shaver style power lead and 3 pin plug adaptor\n- 3 year guarantee\nHazards and Cautions\n- Always keep out of the reach of children.

Important: Always use the scoop provided, please note the colour of the scoop in this pack may change from time to time.\nThis product is made to strict hygiene standards but because powdered formula milks are not sterile, failure to follow instructions on preparation and storage may make your baby ill.\nPrep: Wash hands and sterilise all utensils.\nWater: Boil 1 litre of freshly run water in a kettle then leave to cool for 30 minutes and no more so the water can reach the recommended temperature of 70°C. When ready, pour the right amount of water into a sterilised bottle as per the feeding guide.\nDo not use artificially softened or repeatedly bolled water.\nPowder: Using the scoop, add the powder to the water, as per the feeding guide. To make sure the right amount of powder is added, use the leveller on the inside of the box to level off the scoops. Don't press or heap the powder as adding too much or too little formula could make your baby ill.\nShake: Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle and shake straight away. For best results, shake vertically and vigorously for at least 10 seconds, until all of the powder is dissolved.\nCool the bottle by placing under a cold running tap or in a bowl of cold water, and check the temperature by placing a few drops on the inside of your wrist. The formula should feel lukewarm, but not hot. If possible, we'd recommend starting the feed straight away and always finishing within 2 hours.\nImportant feeding and storage advice\nMake up each feed as required.\nFor hygiene reasons, do not store made up feeds, discard unfinished feeds as soon as possible, and always within 2 hours.\nDo not heat feeds in a microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding.\nNever add extra scoops or anything else to your baby's feed.\nNever leave your baby alone during feeding.\n\"}\nHazards and Cautions\nFood Supplements are intended to supplement the diet and should not be regarded as a substitute for a balanced and varied diet or a healthy lifestyle.\n\nWhile every care has been taken to ensure this information is as accurate as possible, recipes and nutrition content may occasionally change.

Infant Milk is suitable from birth, when babies are not breastfed and should only be used on the advice of a doctor, dietitian, pharmacist, or other professional responsible for maternal and child care.\n\nWhen bottle feeding do not allow prolonged or frequent contact of milk feeds with your baby's teeth as this increases the risk of tooth decay.
